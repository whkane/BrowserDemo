I see Roman legions. I see men who took to the seas to explore new worlds. I see a handful of Spartans standing up to thousands, knowing full well their fate. I see small nation states repel empires. I see Europe stand up against the marauding hordes that raped and pillaged her for hundreds of years and say: No more! I see white headstones as far as the eye can see on those cliffs in Normandy. Headstones of men who did not want to go, but went anyway, because they knew it had to be done and they were the ones who had to do it. I see proud men who took a stand to protect what was theirs, and who paid the ultimate price, but did so willingly – gleefully even – knowing that the price was worth it because of who and what they paid it for, and that they would be remembered. I see heroes.\n\nAnd then I see you. And I see how you have failed them. What do you think the men who came before you would say to you if you were to cross the darkest water now and face them? Would they laugh at your weakness? Or would they cry if they saw all their sacrifices over centuries and generations being betrayed by you? How you willingly surrendered to those same hordes they protected their homes, their women and children from. How you sold the freedoms and independence they fought for to faceless centralised governments for a little personal gain? Would they drive their swords through you, and could you honestly say they were not justified in doing so?\n\nWe have become a society of proud victims. The highest value in our inverted world is not to offend. The highest achievement to extract power and resources from better men by being a victim. Not to struggle, build, persevere and create something for you and for others. The modern slave does not strive to rise from under the yoke, but he uses the collective weight of the masses to pull everyone down to his level, so that others will not see how utterly useless he is. Does that make you proud? Does that give you a feeling of satisfaction? Is that all you are capable of? Why were those men on those beaches able to face the machine guns and climb up that cliff, but you can’t face disagreement or climb up off your own ass? Does it make you feel like you are entitled to something just because you belong to a victim class of your own choosing?\n\nWhy would you want to be a victim? Why would you even strive to be equal? Why would you not want to be better? Diversity, tolerance, equality, those are all creeds of slaves. Weak men, who lack the imagination to become something, and the courage to make it happen. Let these worthless squirming victims be victims, and become gods. For gods is what you will be, when you renounce their slave morality, find your will to power, refuse to give them anything and become their masters. You are the descendants of great European men. Protectors, conquerors, explorers, inventors – men who built this world. Act like one and eventually deserve your place on the Elysian Fields by their side.
